If you are using this diskette on an IBM PC with an add-on
Z80 board you will have to convert the .CPM to .COM with
the appropiate program that was supplied with your board.

If you are running on a Z80 system, that can read IBM PC 
diskettes, all you need to do is to rename all the .CPM
files to .COM files.
