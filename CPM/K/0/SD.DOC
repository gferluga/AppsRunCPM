			Super Directory program
			-----------------------

INTRODUCTION:
------------

This is a help guide to operate the CP/M-80 Super Directory program.  It
is often renamed to "DIR.COM" on RCP/M systems or on systems running CCP
replacements that allow an external directory program.	It is one of the
most useful and one of the most versatile programs available for CP/M-80
computers.  It can direct its output the the CRT, to a printer or to a
disk file for later reference.	It can alphabetize a directory either
vertically or horizontally (selected when assembling the program but
can be changed to the other mode at any time for the current display.)
It shows how many files have been used on the current drive/user area,
how much space this has taken and how much space remains.  Those and
other useful features are mentioned below.  Spend at least a few moments
looking at the quick-reference option list as you may find some things
are now available that would be quite helpful when using your computer.


	To get a HELP Summary of Options:

			B0>SD ?
			  or
			B0>SD //	(if ZCPR33 equate YES)

	Example of Option Usage:

			B0>SD $ANDLV (...etc.)

(The "$"  denotes start of commands but "/" or "[" may also be used.)


QUICK SUMMARY OF OPTIONS:
-------------------------

     A -  all user areas allowed, (0-15), some systems (0-31)
     C -  shows file sizes in records, rather than 'k'
     D -  all  drives starting with first available (usually A:)
     F -  file "DISK.DIR" created/appended to show disk contents
     H -  shows all user areas from here to highest
     L -  LBR/ARC/ARK list option (shows names of member files)
     N -  defeats the page pause, permits non-stop display
     O -  shows only $SYS files in directory
     P -  copies output to printer
     Q -  shows files that have NOT yet been archived
     R -  resets  disk, if not already logged in
     S -  include any $SYS files
     T -  sorts files by type (extent)
     V -  shows version number and date
     X -  uses alternate listing format (horizontal/vertical)
     1 -  files must have attribute 1 set
     2 -  files must have attribute 2 set
     3 -  files must have attribute 3 set
     4 -  files must have attribute 4 set

For all changes made to support Z80DOS date stamping, search this file
for the string "Z80DOS".

"Z80DOS support"
     = -  Show files whose date matches input date exactly
     + -  Show files whose date is equal or after input date
     - -  Show files whose date is before input date
     ! -  Use creation date for matches
     % -  Use alteration date for matches
     @ -  Use last access date for matches
     Z -  Do not display file dates


COMMENTS:
---------
Using the $D option automatically starts on the first available drive
(usually A:) regardless of what drive you were on when you started.  It
then checks all available drives.  Similarly, using the $A option will
always start with User 0 and individually display each available user
area.  If desired you can include a specified drive/user area on the
command line.  Any of the following can be used:

OPTIONAL COMMANDS:
----------------

"A" -	All users:  Causes SD to display the directories of all
	the user areas starting at user 0 and continuing to the
	maximum available.  Most systems have 16 user areas 0-15
	but CP/M+ etc., can have 32 user areas 0-31.

"C" -	Shows file sizes in records: Gives individual cile sizes
	in records instead of "k".  Sizes are followed by "r"
	instead of the normal "k" to indicate this option in ef-
	fect.  Totals and library summary lines are still given
	in "k". Very nice on larger disk systems where 16k might
	be anything from 97-128 records.

"D" -	All disk option: Allows SD to search all disk drives on-
	line.  	It starts with the disk drive specified or im-
	plied with the command line filename.	Example:

		B0>SD $D       Shows all drives starting with A:
		B0>SD C:$D     SHows all drives starting with C:

"F" -	File option: The directory output will be sent to a disk
	file named "DISK.DIR" on the default drive. If this name
	already is present on that drive then the directory out-
	put will be appended to the end of the file.  "DISK.DIR"
	will otherwise start as a new file.  The append feature
	allows you to build up one massive file on the default
	drive that contains the directories of all of your disks
	without having to concatenate a lot of individual files.

"H" -	From here option:  Displays files on all user areas from
	current to highest allowed (usually area 15 unless on a
	RCPM system.)  It it handy to use on systems that have
	MANY files on user 0 area, to see what remains on the
	other user areas.  If on B5: for example, using $H would
	show files on all user aread from B5: through B15: if
	permitted to go that high.  (The $A option is ignored if
	included, else the $H option would not be requested.)

"L" -	LBR list option:  Allows for listing of ".LBR", ".ARC"
	or ".ARK" file members which are shown followed by their
	length in 'k' (or 'r', if the 'C' option is used).  The
	total length of the entire library is is also shown.
	These are always alphabetized horizontally and may have
	a little border (assembler option) at the left, showing
	it is a library listing.

"N" -	No page option:  Shows the display without stopping each
	when the screen is full.  Particularly useful for remote
	users on an RCPM so they can display the entire director
	non-stop for disk copy, etc. by using $AND, etc.

"O" -	Shows only $SYS files: Very useful on large system where
	it is harder to notice an occasional $SYS file.

"P" -	Copy output to printer:  Highlighting characters are not
	sent (for files that are archived or set as $SYS files)
	and the "N" option is automatically selected to prevent
	[more] pauses.  To insure the file names are similar in
	appearance, only upper-case characters are sent to the
	printer.

"Q" -	Shows unarchived files:  Show the files that do NOT have
	the archive flag in a file's directory entry, set.  This
	will show new files that have been recently added to the
	disk. For example, to see a list of ALL new files in ALL
	user areas of ALL drives:

		B0>SD $ADQ <ret>

	To see the new files in just the area that you are cur-
	rently logged into, enter:

			B0>SD $Q <ret>

	(Note: This is worthless on systems that do not use any
	archive backup system.)

"R" -	Reset disk system:  A disk system reset is done before
	directory information is accumulated. Useful to show the
	correct free space remaining when a new disk has been
	inserted, etc.  (Without a reset, it will show the re-
	maining space for whatever disk was last logged in.) Not
	useful and a waste of time on a hard drive.)

"S" -	Include $SYS files:  Files with the $SYS attribute set
	are normally not displayed.  This option includes them.
	Also see the "O" which displays ONLY the $SYS files.

"T" -	Order files by type:  Alphabetizes files by type (exten-
	sion).  This groups files of the same type together such
	as .ASM, COM, LBR.)

"V" -	SD Version number, suffix, and date is displayed.

"X" -	Use alternate listing format - If vertical alphabetiza-
	tion is in effect normally, using this option will cause
	a horizontal listing to be shown.  If horizontal is the
	default, then this option produces a vertical listing.
"1" -
"2" -
"3" -
"4" -	Show only files that meet all other criteria and also have
	this file attribute set. These may occur alone or with each
	other, or with any other criteria. IE:
		SD /1
		SD /23
		SD /1234
		SD /SQ12
	Wheel controllable as is /S.

"Z80DOS support"

"=" -   The date on the command line will be used for exact matches
	with the date of the file.

"+" -	The date on the command line will be used for matching the 
	files whose date was on or after the files date.

"-" -	The date on the command line will be used for matching all
	files whose date was before this date.

"!" -	The files creation date as known by Z80DOS will be used.

"%" -	The files alteration date as known by Z80DOS will be used.

"@" -	The files last access date as know by Z80DOS will be used.

"Z" -   Do not display file dates. Gives 4 across display on 80 col
	screens (vs 2 with dates).

Z80DOS support notes:

	1: If no date spec such as ! or % or @ is given, the files
	   alteration date will be used.
	2: If no matching spec such as = or + or - is given, the match
	   will be an exact one.
	3: If an input line such as SD / 7/2/88 is given, the default
	   will be the files alteration date will be matched exactly.
	4: Date math now allows a range of dates to be specified for
	   matching files. Note that the options =+- become don't cares
	   when specifying a range.
	5: Date math allows relative modifiers to a date, such that you
	   can specify + or - 255 days from a given date. Note that
	   the date, the + -, and the relative are NOT separated by spaces.
	6: When * is used as the date, it means current system time.
	7: If the alteration or access date is requested, (or default alter)
	   and that date is null(0) for the file, the program will revert
	   to the creation date for a comparisons/display.
