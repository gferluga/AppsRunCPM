SD-RCPM.INF             USING SD.COM on an RCPM                3 Feb 89


Information on how to  install/use  SD on RCPM systems.  Read the SD.HIS
file for the history of updates to this program.


    NOTE:  May be assembled with ASM, LASM, M80, MAC, or SLRMAC


        Any of three option markers may be used (/, [ or $):

        SD $A    SD *.COM $A  -  DRI's  "MAC-type"
        SD /A    SD *.COM /A  -  UNIX or ZCPR3 type
        SD [A    SD *.COM[A   -  CP/M+ type, note no space after
                                 FN/FT - a A trailing "]" may be
                                 used, needed but is not needed.
                                 Example:  SD *.COM[AND]


        File lengths over four megabytes are read correctly.

        Files may be shown in vertical or horizontal listings.


RCPM-SPECIFIC OPTIONS:
----------------------
There are a number of ways to limit the maximum drive and user area that
the remote user can access.  The Sysop may set his own access different-
ly.  The list  of drives and users areas  in the "LODRV" area  overrides
all other  selections.  Set that to the highest drive the Sysop wants to
access for his own local needs.  Also set  the maximum user in the LODRV
table for the Sysop's use.

The remote user can then be limited by the BBS system, by BYE5 or by the
type of CCP replacement you might have, such as ZCMD, ZCPR33, etc.

If assembled with the ZCPR33 equate set YES, then the max drive/user and
wheel value as contained in the ZCPR3 ENV will be used as the limiting
values (over-ridden by LODRV area). This implies a Z3 system, of course.

NOTE: for use on ZCPR34+ systems that have the Drive Vector, there is
      an internal equate DRVVEC that will allow the program to dynamically
      build it's LODRV/HIDRV table. Locking out drives not set in the
      vector and setting those that are to Z3's max user from the
      environment if no wheel, and to MXZUSR if wheel is on.


Normally the  MAXDRV, MAXUR and WHEEL  options  are all set YES for RCPM
use.  The potential flexibility is tremendous.

MAXDRV  EQU     no              ;*Yes if MAXD byte is supported
MAXUR   EQU     no              ;*Yes if MAXU byte is supported
WHEEL   EQU     no              ;*Yes if using ZCPR wheel byte

MXDRV   EQU     3DH             ;*Set to max drive location if MAXDRV=Yes
MXUSR   EQU     3FH             ;*Set to max user  location if MAXUR=Yes
WHLOC   EQU     3EH             ;*Set to wheel location if WHEEL=Yes
    ( the above three are don't cares with ZCPR33 set YES )

MXZUSR  EQU     15              ; Maximum user # allowed with WEEL set


WHEEL SPECIFIC OPTIONS:
----------------------
The following 6 options  would normally be set NO for RCPM use. They are
then available if/when the  WHEEL byte is set high.  (If set YES, ignore
the WHEEL byte value and area always available.  The USER is normally of
no use on a RCPM system where disks are never replaced.)

USEF    EQU     no              ;*Allow making a local disk copy?
USEO    EQU     no              ;*Allow showing only $SYS files?
USEP    EQU     no              ;*Allow making local printer listing?
USER    EQU     no              ;*Allow disk system reset? (For floppies)
USES    EQU     no              ;*Allow showing all, AND $SYS files?
USEA	EQU	no		;*Allow specifying file attrib's 1-4

GENERAL COMMENTS:
----------------
Up to 19 command line options  may be specified.  (They are mentioned in
detail in the .DOC file but are:

              A,C,D,F,H,L,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,V,X,1,2,3,4

SD adds another 7 command line options available if used under Z80DOS:

		      =,+,-,!,%,@,Z

They may be either  upper or lower case.  Their  order is not important,
For example either $AND or $DNA are equally effective.  If using the '['
separator (normal for CP/M+ systems) do not use a space:

        B>SD [A         ok, shows all files this drive/user area
        B>SD *.COM[A    note, no space here, else will not work


SPECIAL OPTIONS:
----------------
PRBRDR  - prints a semi-border around the left side of library file mem-
          ber lines if set  YES.  This makes  for a more readable format
          when displaying a large number of LBR files.

USELC   - can be set  to put  the attribute  character(s) into lowercase
          for $SYS, $R/O and $ARC attribute bits.

USELCW  - if set NO, prevents displaying attributes in lower case unless
          wheel byte is active.  (Sysop is using the system.)

REVID   - selects  reverse video  on the  display, if available, to show
          the attribute characters $SYS, $R/O and $ARC.

	  NOTE: For users of ZCRP3+ REVID string is now automatically filled
	        in from the the currently loaded TCAP.

ULINE   - selects  underlining to be used  to display the status line of
          the directory.

SHOPUB  - allows directory display of ZRDOS Public user areas.

WHLPUB  - makes SHOPUB wheel oriented.
