Generating an 8080 or Z80 symbolic instruction debugger
=======================================================

Building a new 8080- or Z80-SID version requires the following steps:

Edit XSID.LIB for proper selection of environment. See this file for equates
to be set TRUE or FALSE.

Edit loader file XSIDLOAD.MAC if necessary, assemble and link it by

	M80 =XSIDLOAD
	LINK XSIDLOAD

The (Z)SID package consists of four files which must be edited if necessary:

	SIDRELO.MAC	The kernel
	SIDLA.MAC	The 8080 assemble/list package
	ZSIDLA.MAC	The Z80 assemble/list package
	SIDCMD.MAC	The command line interpreteer

Compile and link package by

	M80 =SIDRELO		<<-- IGNORE 4 OR 8 ERRORS OF THE FOLLOWING TYPE:

R xxxx'                  C+     PC	aset	$ and 00ffh
R                        C+     IF	PC GT 07fh
R                        C+     IF	PC GT 0
R xxxx'                  C+     	ds	.ds-PC,0

Which will be printed once or twice.

	LINK SIDRELO[OS]	<<-- IMPORTANT OPTION

!!! NOTE: The ZCPR version of SID requires a page boundary for the BIOS tables.
!!!       Observe labels BIOS and .BIOS, which should be close together.

Combine the loader and debugging tool by

	LDBLD XSIDLOAD SIDRELO NEW_FILE

NEW_FILE.COM is the combined executable new version of the debugger
