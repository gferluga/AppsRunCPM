
Z80CCP.ASM is a CCP replacement which I happened to find in 
my library of downloads, collecting dust.  CCP was 
disassembled, enhanced and modified by several authors.  See 
the beginning of Z80CCP.ASM for the list of enhancements and 
features.

It was just two weeks ago when I first installed Carson 
Wilson's excellent Z80DOS BDOS replacement.  I think Z80DOS 
and Z80CCP make a great combination.

WARNING:  Z80CCP with Z80DOS crashes!  I don't know why; it 
may be due to Z80DOS' directories.  Are there any 
"programming sharks" out there that would know?  I'd be 
interested!
