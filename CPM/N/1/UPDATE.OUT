Add the following section as page 8-A:

COMPUTER CUSTOMIZATION:

Customization  to  specific computer system hardware  is  largely 
confined  to certain terminal dependent features that are invoked 
by  a specified code sequence.

Please	refer  to the file HEATH.H and NEC.H for  definitions  of 
these  codes as applied to the Zenith/Heath and NEC APC  computer 
systems,  respectively.   Please  refer to your specific computer 
manuals  for  equivalent codes and then modify and  rename  these 
definition  files  appropriately.   Many of the examples  do  not 
include  these preprocessor definition files,  but rather contain 
the  computer dependent code sequence within the main program  or 
function itself.   This is done largely for tutorial purposes and 
therefor,  such code is not extensive, can be easily isolated and
modified before compiling.

If  you  compile and run examples that contain screen codes  that 
are  not  compatible,  the worst that will usually  happen  is	a 
display  of inappropriate symbols or characters on the screen and 
otherwise  the	program will still run	correctly.   Many  screen 
character  codes  are identical between  computer  systems.   For 
example  decimal code 007 used in EX00.C to ring the bell on  the 
Zenith/Heath will beep on the IBM PC, etc.

Character  codes  for block graphics as used on  the  Zenith  are 
minimal,  since  most other microcomputers either do not  provide 
them or the range of shapes is rather limited.	 Similarly, func-
tion  key and extended character key codes are excluded in  these 
examples.  The inclusion, however, of appropriate fundamentals of 
C  language facilities,  and a minimum amount of screen codes for 
ZENITH/HEATH  and  NEC APC provide excellent  models  from  which 
specific customization may be derived.	

The  following list identifies some basic (first occurrence)  ex-
amples	and  modifications that might be required to  accommodate 
different computer systems:

	   EX05.C - \033E to clear the screen
	   EX07.C - \033p and \033q for reverse video
	   EX18.C - \033Y for direct cursor addressing
	   EX21.C - \033F and \033G for block graphics
	   EX22.C - Heath terminal codes, see HEATH.H
	   EX50.C - Color codes for Z/H100
	   EX51.C - Color for NEC APC


Page 8: Add the following paragraph to the section PREPROCESSORS: 
at top of page:

   Some  compilers  will  not handle  definitions  duplicated  by 
   additional included files. For example, if


			  #define YES 1

   occurs in two .h files, e.g. heath.h and defs.h, both included 

   at the top of your file, the compiler will complain.

TRANSLATE for LUCIDATA PASCAL  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $25.00

Translat  converts  p-codes files into series of  macro-assembler
statements  for  input	to  Microsoft's  M80  assembler.    After
assembling and linking the output from Translat,  you will have a
machine  code  program with execution speed generally  more  than
twice  as  fast as the original p-code version.   For  the  SIEVE
benchmark  on the H100 with CP/M 85,  the following results  were
obtained:

Lucidata Pascal Translate	    166.6 secs. 	 9 KBytes
Lucidata Pascal P-Code		    489.6 secs. 	19 KBytes
MBASIC Interpreter		   1800.0		25 KBytes

Note  the  Sieve program for the p-code case was bound	with  the
runtime system into a .COM 19 KByte file.  

Requires   Polybytes'	Lucidata  V3.8x  (for  CP/M   or   HDOS),
Microsoft's Macro-80 Assembler Package (M80/L80),  and a  minimum
disk configuration of 2 single density disk drives.


Graphics/Sound/Math Support Package . . . . . . . . . . .  $25.00

The  color graphics package supports the arithmetic processor and
the color graphics H8-3/9511 board.   This software package  will
allow  you  to control the sound generator and	graphics  monitor

at a higher level.

Requirements for Lucidata Software:
32K RAM or higher,  HDOS 1.5 or higher,  CP/M 2.0 or higher,  Two 

single density disk drives.  Heath/Zenith computer system.

The  following	package with its programming tutorial provides	a 
useful and completed program as well as a library of source codes 
for customization and development of other applications:

A  programming tutorial on the application of Pascal for accurate
financial analyses.  The financial calculator is chosen to demon-
strate	the advantage of Pascal programming and how H/Z  computer
features are implemented with this language.  Applicable H/Z com-
patible  language processors include Lucidata and  the	IBM(MDOS) 
implementations.  A  source code library of procedures and  func-
tions, similar to those used for A COMPLETE FINANCIAL CALCULATOR,
is provided on disk.  Requires Heath/Zenith computer system, 32K, 
CP/M 2.0+.  

A COMPLETE FINANCIAL CALCULATOR . . . . . . . . . . . . .  $19.95
Provides  "what-if",  on-screen analysis of time-valued financial
transactions.	It  is a highly accurate program that  simplifies
the solution of complex financial analyses.   Interactive  selec-
tion  of financial parameters include ordinary	annuity,  annuity
due,  continuous compounding,  discrete compounding,  compounding
frequency  and	payment frequency Any one of the  five	financial
variables,  time period,  interest rate, payments, present value,
and future value are returned for keyboard entry of the remaining
four  variables  and selected transaction  parameters.	 Includes
function key print commands for selected solutions and	amortiza-
tion  schedules.  Requires Heath/Zenith computer system with CP/M
2.0 or higher,	32K RAM or larger, and one (two preferred) single
