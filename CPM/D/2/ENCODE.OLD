     ENCODE is pseudo compiler for dBASE II version 2.4 or
higher command files.  Programs encoded with ENCODE will run
with the regular version of dBASE II version 2.4 or higher.
Ashton-Tate's RUNTIME is not required, although it could be
used.  RUNTIME is simply an amputated version of dBASE II
that only has the ability to run programs, not edit them.











		Calling a Directory Listing

     To call a directory from the title screen simply enter the drive
you wish to list.

Filename.SRC or Drive:? A:

   This will list the directory of drive A and give the prompt again.

Directory of drive A:
FOO	.CMD	DBSOURCE.BAS	DBSOURCE.COM	BRUN	.COM	A10	.CMD
ENCODE	.BAS	ENCODE	.COM	MBASIC	.COM	D	.COM	SAMPLE	.CMD
BOOKS	.DBF	BOOKS	.FRM	DBASE	.COM	CLS	.DAT	TERMSET	.BAS

CLONE	.CMD	TEST	.CMD	CLONE	.SRC	A10	.OLD	DBSRC2	.COM

Filename.SRC or Drive:?


    The ZCPR like drive call of A; will also work to call the directory,
even if you are not running ZCPR.  The Filename.SRC may be entered here or
a <RETURN> will redisplay the start screen.
