SAMPKEY.DOC:
Sample Macros for ZDE, 01 June 90 by Carson Wilson.

This file describes the sample macros contained in SAMPKEY.ZDK 
and SAMPKEY.ZDT.  As distributed, ZDE contains no Macro Key 
definitions.  I have included the SAMPKEY.* files both to give 
you an idea of the versatility available through ZDE's macro 
capability and to provide you with some useful choresaving 
routines.  Many of the sample Macros come directly from the ZDE 
Manual, and illustrate the use of conditional testing, jumps, and 
control key entry from within Macros.  In addition to being 
educational, most of these "sample" Macros do useful work.  While 
you may (and should) define ZDE's Macros to do anything you wish 
(or nothing, if you wish), I think you may find one or more of 
these samples useful just as they are.

To install the macros in SAMPKEY.ZDK (or any .ZDK file) into your 
copy of ZDE, just type "ZDENSTAL ZDE SAMPKEY.ZDK."  Then exit 
ZDENSTAL with the <S>ave option.  This produces a working copy of 
ZDE.COM with Macro Keys 0 to 9 as defined in the .ZDK file.

To alter or replace the Macros in SAMPKEY.ZDK, first edit the 
text file SAMPKEY.ZDT with ZDE.  Then translate SAMPKEY.ZDT into 
a new macro file with the command "ZDKCOM SAMPKEY.ZDT."  You can 
also translate .ZDK files back into .ZDT files if you wish; see 
ZDKCOM.DOC for more information.

The following briefly describes each of the Macros in the SAMPKEY 
files:


MACRO 0 - SWAP CHARACTERS.

     Macro Text:
          q^S^S^G^D^U^U^D^G

     Purpose:
          "Softens" Hard Carriage Returns from the line the cursor 
          is on to the end of the paragraph.  This allows 
          reformatting with ^B of files from other word 
          processors.


MACRO 2 - MOVE TO START OF SENTENCE.

     Macro Text:
          q^[~.1^S^[1^[~.<^[2^D^[= 2^[=^M2

     Purpose:
          Moves the cursor to the beginning of the sentance the 
          cursor is currently on.


MACRO 3 - MOVE TO START OF PARAGRAPH.

     Macro Text:
          q^QS^S^S^[= [^D^D

     Purpose:
          Moves the cursor to the beginning of the paragraph the 
          cursor is currently on.


MACRO 4 - REFORM AND RETURN.

     Macro Text:
          q^B^QP

     Purpose:
          Reformat beginning with the line the cursor is on and 
          return cursor to current location.  Useful when 
          revising text in the middle of a paragraph.


MACRO 5 - BROWSE FILE.

     Macro Text:
          n^[;^C^[![

     Purpose:

     Purpose:
          Erases the word to the left of the cursor.


MACRO 7 - UNDERLINE WORD RIGHT.

     Macro Text:

     Purpose:
          Brackets the word to the right of the cursor with the 
          control code ^S, causing the word to be underlined when 
          printed (NOTE: printer must be installed).

          the cursor with it.  Can be used to move a single line 
          up any distance within your file.

     Macro Text: n^QE^QS^N^N0=SwCh 1=Soft 2=SentBg 3=ParaBg 
                 4=Reform 5=Browse 6=DelLft 7=Undl 8=SwLn 9=Hlp 
                 ^[;^[;^[;^Y^Y^QP
