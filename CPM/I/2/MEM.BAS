	mem.bas  --  display CP/M memory map

	Addresses for BDOS and CCP are calculated from BIOS base 
	and will reflect actual rather than apparent locations.  
	TPA calculation will therefore correctly reflect reduction 
	in available memory that occurs when a resident system
	extension (RSX) is installed.
