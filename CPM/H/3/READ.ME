   Dear Turbo Tutor customer,

   This disk contains the source files for the examples in
   the manual so that you may use them without having
   to type them in.

   We have added one last example after going to press,
   FILTER.PAS, which should find it's place in a future
   printing in the third part of the manual, subsection
   "MS-DOS routines". We thought that this example would
   be useful to those of you trying to write simple
   filters in Turbo Pascal.

   We also have added the source code LISTT.PAS for
   a Turbo Pascal lister. This is a large program that
   uses all sorts of techniques. We thought that you
   might want to look at it, use its compiled version
   and eventually modify it to fit your individual
   needs.

   Here is a summary of the content of this disk:

   Example files for Part I

  IMPORTANT:  Borland now has a dedicated SIG (Special
  _________   Interest group) on CompuServe. hundreds of
              Turbo Pascal owners use it as a forum
              where tricks, tips, knowledge can be
              exchanged. We at Borland will also provide you
              with technical support and/or customer
              service online! If you don't have a CompuServe
              account number we suggest that you go
              to your closest software dealer and buy
              a "Starter Kit". Once you have an access
              number, just type:

                       GO BOR <RETURN>

              Then follow the instructions. This is a
              great way to communicate with hundreds of
              Turbo Pascal programmers. You will notice
              that these programmers range from absolute
              novices all the way to proven professionals.



  We will of course appreciate any suggestions you might have.

  We hope that this manual will be helpful and wish you
           "Happy programming"

    Yours trully

         Borland International.

  PS: Who is Frank Borland ?

            Frank Borland is more
     mystique than mystic, as elusive
     as the Trinity Alps big foot, as
     shy as the famous Loch Ness
     monster. Even at Borland
     International, his namesake, few
     people have ever seen him. The
     old-timers recognize him for his
     remarkable algorithms, still the
     fastest in the west.

            Borland lives deep in the
     Santa Cruz mountains with his
     transportable computer, his
     burro, and his dogs. While he
     doesn't have a permanent
     homestead, he keeps a couple of
     semi-permanent camps deep in the
     redwood groves, where the sun's
     glare rarely reflects on his
     monitor. He'll occasionally drop
     into Scott's Valley for
     provisions, but communicates
     with the rest of the world
     rarely, and mainly by modem.

            You Compuserve users are
     closer to Frank Borland than you
     realize. He is writing either a
     gothic novel or an epic poem --
     he hasn't decided which --
     entirely in bulletin board
     messages left on different SIGS.
     But he never uses his real name,
     and he switches names often, so
     his writing is hard to follow.
     Look for messages in cadence, or
     rhymes.

            Frank is a warm-hearted
     person. He wrote Sidekick, his
     latest programming effort, for
     humanitarian reasons. Carrying
     notepads, calculator, and
     calendar from camp to camp was
     beginning to stunt the growth of
     his burro, Lotus, so he wrote
     Sidekick to make all that
     unnecessary. He left a note in
     our mailbox, saying he'd saved
     Lotus' development.

            He rarely talks about his
     background, or why he chose to
     abandon normal life and take to
     the mountains. Some say it had
     do to with changing the whole
     motherboard on a PC, just to
     replace a single chip. Others
     blame the high price of
     microcomputer software. We don't
     really know.

                 Do you?
